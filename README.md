# Unexpected Null Handling in JavaScript Function

This repository demonstrates a common JavaScript error related to unexpected behavior when null values are passed as function parameters.

## Bug Description
The `foo` function is designed to add two numbers. However, its current implementation incorrectly handles null values. Instead of throwing an error or providing more robust null handling, it simply returns 0.  This behavior might be unexpected and could lead to hidden errors in larger applications.

## Bug Reproduction
1. Clone this repository.
2. Open `bug.js`
3. Run the JavaScript code.
4. Observe the unexpected output for null parameters.

## Solution
The `bugSolution.js` file provides a corrected version of the function, which includes more robust null handling. 

## Recommendations

* Always explicitly check for null or undefined values in function parameters and handle them appropriately. 
* Consider using strict equality (`===`) instead of loose equality (`==`) to avoid unexpected type coercion issues when handling nulls.
* Throwing a more informative error for unexpected input values is recommended to prevent silent failures in the application.
